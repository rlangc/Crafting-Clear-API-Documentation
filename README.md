<h2>1. Introduction</h2

The Learning Management System (LMS) API provides a robust, RESTful interface that allows developers to integrate LMS functionalities into external applications. This API enables programmatic access to courses, users, enrollments, assessments, reporting, and other critical LMS features.

This documentation outlines API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, request/response formats, error handling, and best practices to help developers efficiently interact with the LMS API.

<h2>2. Authentication</h2>

The LMS API uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. Every request must include a Bearer Token in the header.

```

Response:

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGci...",

5. Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the LMS API enforces rate limits:

    Standard Users: 100 requests per minute
    Premium Users: 500 requests per minute

If rate limits are exceeded, the API returns:

{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again later."
}

6. Webhooks

Webhooks notify clients of changes in real time.

    User Enrolled: POST /webhooks/enrollment
    Course Published: POST /webhooks/course_published
